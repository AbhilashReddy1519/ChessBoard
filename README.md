AI Chess Project üß†‚ôüÔ∏è
Welcome to my first project, where I bring together Artificial Intelligence and the timeless game of Chess! üéâ

About the Project
This project demonstrates how AI can analyze and make decisions on a chessboard. The AI isn't just playing the game‚Äîit‚Äôs thinking several moves ahead, simulating human-like strategies to compete effectively against players.

Why I Built This
AI Enthusiasm: As a Computer Science enthusiast, I wanted to explore how AI can interact with traditional games.
Learning Milestone: Being my first project, this was an exciting opportunity to dive into concepts like algorithms, decision-making, and Python programming.
Chess Inspiration: Chess is a classic example of strategy and planning, making it the perfect playground for AI experimentation.
Core Features
AI-Powered Gameplay: The AI evaluates multiple moves using decision-tree algorithms like Minimax or advanced techniques such as Alpha-Beta Pruning.
Dynamic Board Updates: Real-time chessboard visualization for players to follow the moves seamlessly.
Scalable Difficulty: Future updates can include difficulty adjustments based on player experience.
Tech Stack
Python for game logic and AI algorithms.
Pygame for the chessboard interface and visualization.
AI Algorithms like Minimax for decision-making.

Hi guys, worrying about pygame library dont worrry i will explain you step by step how to download it ok
Installing Pygame 
1.  Locate the Python Scripts Folder
  Search for Python in the Start menu.
  Right-click and choose "Open File Location" (do this twice to reach the actual installation folder).
  Navigate to the Scripts folder (e.g., C:\Program Files\Python36\Scripts) and copy its path.

2.  Open command prompt in windows
  press windows+R type cmd so command prompt will open

3.  Change Directory to Scripts in cmd
  In cmd, type:
  cd 'C:\Path\To\Scripts'
  press enter

4.   Install Pygame
  Run the following command:
  .\pip install pygame
    If this doesn‚Äôt work, try:
  .\pip3 install pygame
5.  Verify Installation
  Check the lib\site-packages folder in your Python directory to ensure Pygame is installed.
here we created two functions for drawing board and
